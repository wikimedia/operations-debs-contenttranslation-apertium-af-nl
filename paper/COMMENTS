~ Ok, this is some notes from my read through the article. It mixes
~ general and specific, large and small issues here, simply so that I know
~ it is done and sent before I run out of time to write it nicely. Sorry
~ if anything sounds blunt or harsh - definitely not intended. It is a
~ nice article, I think.
~ 

Abstract doesn't say much, but that was just an impression.

I think there are more than 5 million Afrikaans speakers. I think we
need a better source here.

~The reference to Donaldson looks very strange - it is from 1993 but
~comes after talking about the eleven official languages that only came
~into law in 1996 (if I remember correctly).
~
~
~ "parallel corpora for both languages" sound strange. "parallel corpus
~ for the two languages"?
~ 
~ http://opus.lingfil.uu.se/KDE4v2.php
~ 404 - should be http://opus.lingfil.uu.se/KDE4.php  I guess
~ 
~ 
~ I guess this is the KDE translations that are pivoted over English? You
~ could do the same for other stuff like Firefox, OpenOffice.org, GNOME,
~ etc. with the big difference being that these Afrikaans translations
~ were done by humans. Most of the KDE stuff is completely unusable for
~ anything, in my opinion (last time I looked, anyway).  We have a tool to
~ do that in the Translate Toolkit - poswap. I think this will do that.
~ For an easier ride, you could download the two language databases from
~ open-tran.eu and link them up easily. Lots of data, but includes
~ garbage, like KDE. This is also obviously pivoted, and in domains where
~ I think we might differ more on a lexical level, and even stylistic ones
~ (Dutch uses infinitives for UI buttons, whereas we usually use
~ imperative).
~ 
~ 
~ Figure 2 is really small to read.
~ 
~ The section on number of nouns in Wiktionary is worded in a confusing
~ way. I assume the 10610 is from the _English_ wiktionary? People not
~ familiar with wiktionary might not understand why the Dutch nouns have a
~ corresponding category on the Dutch wiktionary - where else would they
~ be than the Dutch wiktionary (of course _I_ know :-)
~ 
~ "After the morphological analysers for both languages were large enough"
~ How do you measure the size of an analyser? Is "coverage" or something
~ else meant?
~ 
Under 2.2.2 I really miss something about false friends. Van Huyssteen
and Pilon mentioned this, and I think it is an important to handle. It
is also easy to at least do something about it (like rip theirs). Their  "review the list of false friends in .Van... to see if any translations can be improved"
license is CC-by, but I guess you can also get a list or two on the web
with different licenses, and we can maybe at least try to compile it by
hand. I think this is a shortcoming, specifically because it was
discussed in the only prior publication in this field.

~2.3.1: I _think_ Afrikaans has word-attached genitives (except that I
~don't know what they are). They are only in archaic forms, I think, so
~maybe you have a reference there? I'm not good with these things, but
~maybe we should just make sure.
~
~ "have + nie ..." - a bit strange mixing English and Afrikaans here.
~ 
In general, I find it a bit hard to work out if an example text (usually   "in all examples, first line afrikaans, second line dutch,..."
nicely italicised) is Dutch or Afrikaans, so I guess an unfamiliar
reader might struggle as well. Maybe a convention of appending (af) or
(nl) afterwards might help in some cases, although it could clutter
things, so it is just an idea. It is probably only important in a few
cases.

The 3 bullets at the end of 2.3.1 is a bit strange... where do they fit
in?

~2.3.2 - of course compounds can contain more than just nouns. Some forms
~with adjectives also combine productively, usually in 3 part compounds.
~
~ "infrastruktuurontwikkelingsplan" should be hyphenated as
~ "in-fra-struk-tuur-ont-wik-kel-ings-plan" if it is going to be
~ hyphenated.
~ 
~ 
I don't really get compound-L and compound-R, but maybe my background is
just lacking here. Do you mean that something like "ontwikkelings" (with
the -s-) can only occur on the "left" of a compound?

~ 2.4 needs some text to explain the numbers
~ 
3 - the fifth evaluation was not done or reported on later (3.5), so
maybe take it out here?

Should table 3 still get the "realistic" scores?

~ "Another issue are relative pronouns" - are -> is?
~ 
~ 
~ I think the English is wrong here:
~ 
~ Die sand het dan saam met die water weggespoel.
~ Het zand heeft dan samen met het water weggespoeld.
~ Het zand is dan samen met het water weggespoeld.
~ ‘The sand is washed away along with the water.’
~ 
~ I think the Dutch here is passive past tense, so I think the English
~ should be "The sand was washed away along with the water." A direct
~ translation for the Afrikaans from me would rather be "Then the sand got
~ washed away with the water." or "Then the sand was washed away with the
~ water." but it could depend on context, I guess.
~ 
~ Typo: chuncks
~ 
~I think the correction to error 9 has more to it. Here the confusion of
~the with-or-without-final '-e' in the adjectives of Afrikaans should be
~taken into account, I think. If it is there, the adjective necessarily
~describes the noun, but if it isn't there and the adjective can
~optionally take it before a noun, it means that the adjective describes
~the following adjective. I'm not sure how that would influence the
~Dutch, but it seems as if the proposed solution might be a bit too
~simple. Example:
~
~Die onlangs verwagte reën het gekom.
~The recent  expected rain have came. (literal)
~The recently expected rain arrived. (+-)
~
~Here "onlangs" describes "verwagte", not "reën". Not sure if that is
~relevant, though.
~
~
~ The hyphenation is wrong for "meewerk". It should be "mee-werk" (even
~ for Dutch, I assume)
~ 
~No solution is offered for error 10. I guess it has to do with the way
~the infinitive works in Dutch after "zonder"?
~
~
~ "algemeen" not italicised at the end of 3.4.6 (there are some
~ inconsistencies with Afrikaans/Dutch words that aren't always
~ italicised)
~ 
~ The rule about "klinkerbotsing" exists in Afrikaans as well. I think we
~ just call it "vokaalopeenhoping", although I immediately knew what
~ "klinkerbotsing" meant.
~ 
~
~"’n Jaar later ruk die situasie in die land onder die indruk van
~massabetogings hand uit."
~I see this in [[af:Duitsland]], but it is a strange sentence, so if you
~can use another example, it might avoid a double take by an Afrikaans
~reader, as I had. The "onder die indruk van" sounds strange to me.

3.5 still outstanding.


I hope this helps. This work is really exciting!
